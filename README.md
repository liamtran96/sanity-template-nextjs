# sanity-template-nextjs

This is a template for new projects using Next.js with embedded Sanity integration and Sanity Studio
on the `/studio` route.

NOTE: This template intentionally does NOT use Next.js’s experimental `appDir` feature since there
are known issues with this. I’ll wait until their `appDir` feature is stable.

## Features

- Live previews using `next-sanity`.
- Customized Sanity Desk Tool.
- Just TypeScript.
- Eslint configuration.
- Environment variables.
- Tailwind.
